# Molecular Solubility (LogS) Prediction from Molecular Descriptors using Linear Regression

In this project, I built a Linear Regression model to predict molecular solubility (LogS) from molecular descriptors, achieving a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 1.01 and an R^2 of 0.77. I developed a Streamlit web application that accepts a molecule's SMILES notation, computes its descriptors using the RDKit library, and utilizes the trained model for solubility predictions.

### Summary of the steps:

- Import necessary libraries
- Load and Explore the Dataset
- Preprocess the Dataset
- Prepare the Features and Target Variable
- Build and Evaluate the Linear Regression Model
- Visualize the Model Performance
- Save the Model
- Build a Streamlit Web App
